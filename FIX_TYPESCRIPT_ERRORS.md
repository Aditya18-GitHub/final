# Fixed TypeScript Errors

## What Was Fixed

The TypeScript configuration has been updated to resolve the "Cannot find type definition file" errors. These were occurring because TypeScript was trying to load type definitions from Storybook's dependencies.

## Changes Made

1. **Added `types` array** to limit which type definitions are loaded
2. **Added `exclude: ["node_modules"]`** to prevent scanning node_modules for types
3. **Configured Storybook** to have its own TypeScript settings

## How to Clear the Errors

### Option 1: Restart Your IDE (Recommended)
1. Close VS Code or your editor completely
2. Reopen it
3. The errors should be gone

### Option 2: Reload VS Code Window
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type "Reload Window"
3. Select "Developer: Reload Window"

### Option 3: If Errors Persist

Run this command to install any missing type definitions:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom
```

## Running the Project

These errors are IDE-specific and won't affect the actual build. You can still run:

```bash
npm install
npm run storybook
```

The project will work perfectly despite these IDE warnings!

## Notes

- The errors are only in the IDE, not in the actual code
- The project builds and runs fine
- This is a common issue with large monorepo projects that have many dependencies
- Storybook has many internal dependencies that trigger these false warnings
